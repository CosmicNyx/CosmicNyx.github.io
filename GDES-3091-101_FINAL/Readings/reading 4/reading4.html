            You walk away from the loud building. Too much is happening there. Can't focus on one thing at a time. You
            walk away wondering what to do, how to show people who you are, and what you can do in your own controlled
            environment. You slowly build your own little tent, then it grows into a small hut, then a cabin. You
            created this place to organize your things. People come by sometimes, enjoying how you've organized
            everything together. There are many different rooms to explore, all under your control. You can create
            another cabin if you want, you can put however much effort you want into it and maintain it as you wish, but
            the option will always be there. This cabin is your website and yours alone.
