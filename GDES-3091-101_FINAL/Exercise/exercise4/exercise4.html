    <p>For my iframe theme, I decided to list some artsy websites used for drawing and colour selection</p>

    <br>

    <div>
        <!-- JSPAINT -->
        <iframe src="https://jspaint.app/" title="iframe"></iframe>
        <p>This is a website that allows you to paint and draw. There are limited tools but you can still make alot of
            cool stuff.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <!-- SKETCHPAD -->
        <iframe src="https://sketch.io/sketchpad/" title="Iframe"></iframe>
        <p>Just like JSpaint, this is an online drawing tool. However this allows you to work in layers and has many
            different types of tools and a wide selection of colours.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <!-- color hunt -->
        <iframe src="https://colorhunt.co/" title="Iframe"></iframe>
        <p>You can browse through color palletes and even serach up theme and get palletes that match.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <!-- coolors -->
        <iframe src="https://coolors.co/" title="Iframe"></iframe>
        <p>Gives you a random colour pallete each time.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <!-- color hexa -->
        <iframe src="https://www.colorhexa.com/" title="Iframe"></iframe>
        <p>Gives you information on a specific colour and how to use it to its fullest by giving to other colours to use along with it and much more.
        </p>
